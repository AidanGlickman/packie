# Packie

> ""Packie", a slang term for a "package store" (i.e. a liquor store) in Massachusetts"

Packie is a web service capable of collecting prices from multiple liquor stores. This can be used to shop around from the comfort of your computer and find the best price (or even just availability) for your next bottle.

The scope of being able to scrape every liquor store is huge, so to start this is going to target liquor stores that run on [City Hive](https://www.cityhive.net/), a platform used by many.
